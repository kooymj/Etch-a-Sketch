# Etch-a-Sketch

My take on the Etch a Sketch exercise from the Odin Project.
As Extra credit, I was supposed to change to a random color while slowly turning the colors darker until black each time I hover over it.

But I decided to make a CRAYON ETCHING EFFECT instead :P
The colors go from black through the colors of the rainbow and finally white.
Takes me back to my elementary school days and I had a blast making this.
